SUSHEN BISWAS FATHER AI
we use minimal python lighbary
$. http.server (Internal)
$.SQL Alchemy (External : that means you have to install it. normally we use pip install SQLAlchemy to install it.)

There is 4 file . Including a database file.

Three python script and 1 database file.

they are webserver.py, data_map.py, AddSomeExtraUser.py and the database father.db

1. webserver.py is the main file if you run it it will give you a fresh complite application where you can add users.

2. data_map.py is the ORM (Object Relation Mapper) if you run it.It wll give you the database file in my case it is father.db but you can change whatever you want.

3. AddSomeExtraUser.py is a script that can add extra user. When you ran it it will creat some extra user so you can play with it.

4. father.db is database file with some data . If you run data_map.py you always get a father.db file but if you want a blank database just run data_map.py


all taht case is extrem.

if you want to devloped from here just devloped webserver.py
Its complitely ready to work.

thanks. Hope you happy codding.
